 * Feature defines the packaging "container" for a group of related plug-ins,
 * plug-in fragments, and optionally non-plug-in files. 
 * <p>
 * Features are treated purely as an installation and packaging construct. 
 * They do not play a role during Eclipse plug-in execution.
 * They are simply an inclusive "manifest" of the plug-ins, fragments 
 * and other files that make up that feature. If features are logically made 
 * up of plug-ins from "sub-features", the top-level feature "manifest"
 * must be fully resolved at packaging time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface. However, in most cases clients should 
 * directly instantiate or subclass the provided implementation of this 
 * interface.
